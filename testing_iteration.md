# Testing and iteration

The audience for this part of the document is your teamâ€™s fellow engineers. Describe the following:

1. Your strategy for writing tests. If applicable, describe how, if you were given more time to work on this problem, you would seek to make the test suite more robust.
    1. My strategy for writing test was to match closely the unit tests provided given that my background was not in JavaScript. I think that to make the test suite more robust, I would like to test to see if I can get back multiple results.
1. What about your solution you are proudest of.
    1. I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to implement a solution in JS.
1. Which part of the problem was most difficult to solve.
    1. Being that I was new to JS, solving it in JS was the hardest part for me.
1. Optional: Edge cases you addressed in your code, or how you might think about edge cases if you were given more time to work on this problem.
    1. Edge cases I addressed were common, things like empty input or case sensitive. As I said above though, given more time and familiarity, I'd like to make sure that the application is robust enought to handle multiiple results.
